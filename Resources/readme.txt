I recommend using the debian-based liunux distros because they already have a C++ compiler and I recommend running each file from command line, compiling and plotting the output one at a time.

In this file: 
8 preliminary exercises
4 small projects based on the first exercises
The resources are the same as in the tutorial


many thanks to computervision.zone, for the outstanding tutorial.
