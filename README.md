# computer_vision



Computer vision is one of the most interesting branches of computer science, it can be applied to every economic field: from defence to anomaly recognition of any kind and nowadays also in data mining in bureaucratic contexts. here is a personal project written in C++, using OPENCV, an incredible library also available in python. I learned how to program a colour, shape, face and car plate recogniser and a document picker. 


I recommend using the debian-based liunux distros because they already have a C++ compiler and I recommend running each file from command line, compiling and plotting the output one at a time.

In this file: 
8 preliminary exercises
4 small projects based on the first exercises
